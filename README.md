Components includes app features. each component has Data layer, Application Layer and presentation layer, Hence, screens and other UI widgets can use this components easily. This structure also enable us to remove and add features without difficulty. The reason why I exclude screens and some other widgets from features is that we are using features on the screens or in another words inside a widget. so we can use multiple features in a widget or in a screen. so if we put a screen to inside of a feature, we need to communicate with between features. But in this way we are communication on the screens with which feature we want and removing communication between features. This enable us more flexibility when we want to remove or add feature to a screen in the future.    

### Navigation

The application uses the `GoRouter` library for navigation. The navigation structure includes the following screens:

-   Category List
-   Random Joke by Category (navigates from the Category List)
-   Joke Detail (navigates from the Search List or Favorite List)
-   Search
-   Favorites

### Bottom Navigation Bar

A bottom navigation bar is implemented with buttons for Categories, Search, and Favorites. 

### State Management

State management is implemented using the `Riverpod` library. It provides a scalable and maintainable solution for managing the app's state.

### Loading State

A loading indicator is displayed when fetching data to enhance the user experience. The `LoadingIndicator` component is utilized for this purpose.


### Error Handling

Error handling is implemented to prioritize displaying API errors when available.
